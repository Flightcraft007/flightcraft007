(Five out of Five Stars)

I liked this video so much because the scenery kept changing. I saw how amazingly weird Minecraft was before all the updates. Did you know sheep could only be sheared and couldn’t regrow wool when they were first released? It was cool because it was an information report but better which means I was doing school work. It is super funny because he named a parrot “Dinnerbone” which makes it go upside down.  I hadn’t seen it in a video before and it really made me laugh. Since he started the world before Alpha when there was no bedrock he loaded some chunks so he could literally fly in the void. 

Here are five things that made me laugh out loud:
A new mob called the Allay stole his Diamond Shovel. This is a new thing and took me by surprise.
At the start of minecraft you can heal by eating (It literally gives you hearts/health). Imagine jumping off a cliff and breaking both legs in real life and then you eat a Bigmac and you heal completely!
In an update ages ago they added steak and originally it looked different to cooked pork chops.  Now both look witch is really confusing
He almost fell in the void and died on his first day in the overworld
In alpha when you walk it had a really weird animation (like you are on a tightrope)
Imagine this in the caveman era that the only meat is pork chops. And when you cook them, you know what they look like but then in the future, cooked beef appears and now looks identical to the old cooked pork.  At the same time, cooked pork chops change what they look like. What a kerfuffle!
