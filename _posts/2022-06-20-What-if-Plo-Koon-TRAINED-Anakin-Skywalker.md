Three out of Five Stars

I liked this video because it featured Plo Koon and Anakin Skywalker. In this alternate timeline, Anakin trusted Plo more and was the father figure Anakin needed to become a better and stronger jedi. This is not the same as normal Star Wars. Anakin wasn’t tricked by Palpatine and severed every connection except his mother. The thing I didn’t like about this fan fiction is it wasn’t extremely entertaining and was more of an educational video than a fun entertaining one. This wasn’t the most entertaining one I have seen.
