Day One

My dad and I started packing our bags very late in fact we packed on the day we left. At approximately 1:30pm we got into our lightly packed car and started driving towards the Strathbogie Ranges. On the way there we stopped off at Yarra Glen to get some wine and then kept driving until we finally arrived at the Strathbogie Ranges. Out of a group of four families we were second to arrive and there was a big age gap between me and the younger children, Henry and Yun Jun so it was a bit boring until John arrived. We left the house to go to The Games House. As the name suggests there were lots of games inside including Foosball, Pool and a big projector to watch movies on. I spent up to 6 hours in total, which is precisely one sixth of the time I spent at the farm. After doing half an hour of games with John, Zak and Jimmy arrived and we started the Grand Foosball Tournament. I was knocked out in the first round against Jimmy and Zak then knocked out John in the second round and the victor of round three was Jimmy. 

After that Zak and I went back inside the house to do cards. We played Spit and Gin Rummy until dinner. For dinner we had sausages and they were excellent. After dinner the kids crashed on the couch and watched two movies called Captain Underpants and Despicable Me 3. After an eventful day we got into bed at 10:00pm but the day wasn’t over yet. Everyone stayed awake and talked for fifteen minutes but after lights out no one was quiet. Steve, Zak’s dad came and told us to shut up twice but we didn’t listen to him. Then John started threatening Zak that he would wake up the parents and tell on him and he eventually quietened. And then he started talking again. John decided to take Zak’s toy, Wilbert, and wouldn’t give him back. When Zak got up to get Wilbert back Steve came in and told them to go back to bed and stop messing around. He said we were keeping everyone up and that no one could sleep. He left and do you think we stopped? We didn’t. Zak, much quieter, tried to take back Wilbert but John threw it across the room to me. I was about to give it back to John but then Steve came in with a dark expression on his face and said out. Leave and come into their room. Zak prayed to have one last chance and Steve gave it to him. I gave him back  Wilbert and this time everyone was silent and went to sleep.
